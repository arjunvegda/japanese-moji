## Reporting Issues

Before opening an issue, please search the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/arjunvegda/japanese-moji/issues) to make sure your issue hasn't
already been reported.

Please ask any general and implementation specific questions via
[GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/arjunvegda/japanese-moji/discussions)

## Local setup

Visit the [Issue tracker](https://github.com/arjunvegda/japanese-moji/issues) to find a list of open
issues that need attention.

Fork, then clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/japanese-moji.git

This repository uses Yarn v3 to manage this package and documentations. You'll need to have Yarn
v1.22 installed globally on your system first, as Yarn v3 depends on that being available first.
Install dependencies with:

```
yarn install

# if you want to work on the documentation locally
cd website && yarn install
```

## Building

Running the `build` task will create CommonJS, ESM, and a UMD build under `/dist`

```
yarn build
```

## Testing and Linting

We use Jest to test our code. Therefore, yarn run test\* supports passing of all the arguments as
Jest

To run the tests:

```
yarn test
```

To continuously watch and run tests, run the following (supports all the arguments as jest):

```
yarn test:watch
```

To run tests with coverage, run the following (supports all the arguments as jest):

```
yarn test:coverage
```

To perform linting with `eslint`, run the following:

```
yarn lint
```

To perform linting with `eslint` and fix it, run the following:

```
yarn lint:fix
```
